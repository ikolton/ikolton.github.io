		abstract: 'Multi-modal three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging data, derived from ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and potentially computed tomography (CT), provide a widely adopted approach for non-invasive anatomical visualization. Accurate modeling, registration, and visualization in this setting depend on surface reconstruction and frame-to-frame interpolation. Traditional methods often face limitations due to image noise and incomplete information between frames. To address these challenges, we present MedGS, a semi-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction framework that employs a Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based interpolation mechanism. In this framework, medical imaging data are represented as consecutive two-dimensional (2D) frames embedded in 3D space and modeled using Gaussian-based distributions. This representation enables robust frame interpolation and high-fidelity surface reconstruction across imaging modalities.',
